SSH

SSH is used for authentication. It`s like very hard password. It works in following way:
- we give to our partner public key;
- when we try to connect then our partner compares is with our private key and give us permission.

JAVA TRUSTED CERTIFICATES MANAGEMET

Console has to be run in administrator mode.

1. List of trusted certificates 
-------------------------------
On Linux (or GIT console):
keytool -list -keystore "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts"
or in Windows:
keytool -list -keystore "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts"

2. Add trusted certificate
--------------------------
On Linux  (or GIT console):
keytool -import -alias roche -file "C:\java\Roche Root CA 1 - G2.cer" -keystore "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts"
or in Windows:
keytool -import -alias roche -file "C:\java\Roche Root CA 1 - G2.cer" -keystore "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts"

3. Remove trusted certificate
--------------------------
On Linux  (or GIT console):
keytool -delete -alias roche -keystore "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts"

KEYSTORE VS TRUSTSTORE

Keystore contains private key, public key and certificate. It is required if we want to be checked by other application. For instance SSH and checked by browser.
Truststore contains only public key and certificate. It is required if we want to check other application. For instance x509.

To create Truststore from Keystore you have to perform following steps:
- export certificate from Keystore;
- create new Trustore and import certificate. Public key will be imported automatically.
